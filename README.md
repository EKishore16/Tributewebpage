My Inspiration: Ratan Tata
This project is a simple yet elegant webpage dedicated to Ratan Naval Tata, a prominent Indian industrialist and former chairman of Tata Sons. The page highlights his significant contributions to industry and philanthropy. This project is inspired by a list of basic HTML and CSS projects provided by GeeksForGeeks, and it is the first project in that series.

Project Description

A centered header with Ratan Tata's name and a large image.
A detailed list of his notable accomplishments, structured within an attractive, styled content section.
A footer with a link to Ratan Tata's Wikipedia page for more information.
